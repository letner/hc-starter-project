# Hyper Casual Starter Project

This is a simple Unity project that helps to develop hyper-casual games fast.

Keep attention on the gameplay of your hyper-casual game and let HyperCasualSDK do all the boring stuff.

## Features

### Input Controller

- Detects the most common touch gestures
- Event-based architecture: make almost anything react to a gesture with one line of code
- Works in editor and release builds both

### Third-party SDK integration

Import the most popular SDKs from publisher or analytics services and integrate them easily using SDK wrappers 

### Gameplay State Machine

- Has all needed states for common hyper-casual game
- Ability to subscribe to game state changes

### User Interface

Settings menu, multiply reward dialog, lobby view, score counter, etc

### Separate assemblies

Separate assemblies for entire HyperCasualSDK and some of sub-projects reduces build time

### Audio Assistant

- Predefined sounds for the most popular game events
- Integrated vibration controller

### Integrated Cinemachine

- Easy to add cameras and configure them
- Camera reacts to Game State change

Wrapper for an Ad SDK supports the most common ad events

### Screenshot Capturer

### Mobile-friendly materials

- Super-fast still cute water shader
- Unbelievably efficient universal material for objects
- Custom sprite-based digits

### Pre-set Project Settings

Quality settings tiers, basic iOS/Android settings, base physics, all are already pre-set to optimal values

### Custom super-efficient shaders and materials

- Use `Universal_Mat` with `ZIPSTED/Regular` inside as a material for the most of your on-scene objects, and easily switch between color schemes  
- Custom `ZIPSTED/Transparent` shader is perfect for decals such as splashes or bullet holes
- `ZIPSTED/Gradient_Skybox` is a simple gradient skybox from one color to another
